# Asthma Guardian v3 Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratified:** 2024-12-19  
**Last Amended:** 2024-12-19

## Purpose

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles, governance structure, and development standards for Asthma Guardian v3. It serves as the foundational document that guides all technical decisions, architectural choices, and development practices within this project.

## Core Principles

### Clear Purpose & Focus
Good coding projects start with a clear purpose and focus on delivering the simplest version that works before scaling.

**Rationale:** A well-defined purpose prevents scope creep and ensures all development efforts align with core objectives. Starting simple allows for rapid validation and iterative improvement.

### Readable & Well-Documented Code
Code should be readable, well-documented, and tested so it's easy to maintain and extend as requirements change.

**Rationale:** Readable code reduces cognitive load and accelerates development. Documentation and tests serve as living specifications that enable confident refactoring and feature additions.

### Automation & Tool Reuse
Automate repetitive tasks and use existing tools where possible.

**Rationale:** Automation reduces human error and frees developers to focus on high-value work. Leveraging proven tools accelerates development and reduces maintenance burden.

### Security & Privacy by Design
Build with security and privacy in mind from day one.

**Rationale:** Security and privacy are foundational requirements that become exponentially more expensive to retrofit. Early consideration prevents technical debt and protects users.

### Measurement & Observation
Measure and observe your system so you can learn from real-world feedback and improve continuously.

**Rationale:** Data-driven decisions lead to better outcomes. Observability enables proactive issue detection and informed optimization decisions.

### Continuous Improvement
Learn from real-world feedback and improve continuously.

**Rationale:** Systems that adapt to changing requirements and user needs remain valuable over time. Continuous improvement prevents stagnation and technical obsolescence.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Constitution amendments require:
1. Proposal submission with clear rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing codebase and practices
3. Review period of minimum 48 hours
4. Approval by project maintainers
5. Version increment according to semantic versioning
6. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review
- Quarterly review of adherence to principles
- Annual comprehensive constitution review
- Immediate review triggered by significant project pivots
- Documentation of compliance gaps and remediation plans

## Implementation

All project artifacts, including code, documentation, tests, and deployment configurations, MUST align with these principles. Violations should be addressed through:
1. Immediate correction when possible
2. Technical debt tracking for complex changes
3. Process improvements to prevent future violations
4. Team education and training as needed
