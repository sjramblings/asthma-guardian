# Research: Asthma Guardian v3 CDK Infrastructure

## Research Overview
This document outlines the research conducted to inform the implementation of the Asthma Guardian v3 CDK infrastructure project.

## Technical Research

### AWS CDK Python 3.12 Compatibility
- **CDK Version:** AWS CDK v2.x supports Python 3.12
- **Dependencies:** Ensure all CDK constructs are compatible with Python 3.12
- **Best Practices:** Use virtual environments and proper dependency management

### AWS Services Architecture
- **Compute:** AWS Lambda for serverless functions, ECS for containerized services
- **Storage:** DynamoDB for user data, S3 for static assets and logs
- **API:** API Gateway for REST endpoints, AppSync for GraphQL
- **CDN:** CloudFront for global content delivery
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch for metrics and logging, X-Ray for tracing

### Security Considerations
- **Network:** VPC with private subnets for backend services
- **Access:** IAM roles with least privilege principle
- **Encryption:** KMS for key management, encryption at rest and in transit
- **Compliance:** HIPAA considerations for health data

### Performance Requirements
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling groups and serverless components
- **Latency:** CloudFront for global distribution
- **Throughput:** API Gateway throttling and caching strategies

### Technology Choices
- **CDK Language:** Python 3.12 for infrastructure as code
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend:** Python 3.12 with FastAPI for API services
- **Database:** DynamoDB for scalability and serverless compatibility
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch and X-Ray for observability

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **CDK Learning Curve:** Team needs training on CDK constructs
2. **AWS Service Limits:** Potential account limits for new services
3. **Complex IAM:** Proper permissions configuration complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Training:** Provide CDK documentation and examples
2. **Testing:** Use AWS free tier and staging environments
3. **Documentation:** Comprehensive IAM role documentation

## Success Criteria
- CDK project successfully synthesizes and deploys
- All AWS resources properly configured and secured
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure operational
- Documentation complete and up-to-date
