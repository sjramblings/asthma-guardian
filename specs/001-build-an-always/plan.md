# Project Plan Template

## Constitution Check
This plan MUST align with the Asthma Guardian v3 Constitution principles:
- ✅ Clear Purpose & Focus: Plan includes specific, measurable objectives
- ✅ Readable & Well-Documented: Plan is clearly structured and documented
- ✅ Automation & Tool Reuse: Plan leverages existing tools and automates where possible
- ✅ Security & Privacy by Design: Security considerations included from start
- ✅ Measurement & Observation: Success metrics and monitoring defined
- ✅ Continuous Improvement: Feedback loops and iteration cycles planned

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Asthma Guardian v3 CDK Infrastructure  
**Purpose:** Create the base CDK Python project using Python 3.12 to provision the web app and backend AWS infrastructure for the asthma safety application  
**Success Criteria:** Fully functional CDK project that can deploy a complete AWS infrastructure stack including web app hosting, backend services, databases, and monitoring

## Objectives
1. Set up CDK Python project with Python 3.12 and proper project structure
2. Create AWS infrastructure components for web app hosting and backend services
3. Implement security, monitoring, and deployment automation

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture:** AWS CDK with microservices architecture, serverless components, and event-driven design
- **Technology Stack:** Python 3.12, AWS CDK v2, TypeScript for frontend, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront
- **Security Measures:** VPC with private subnets, IAM roles, encryption at rest and in transit, WAF protection
- **Monitoring Strategy:** CloudWatch metrics, X-Ray tracing, structured logging, automated alerting

## Timeline
- **Phase 1:** CDK Project Setup & Core Infrastructure - 2 weeks
- **Phase 2:** Security & Monitoring Implementation - 1 week
- **Phase 3:** Testing & Documentation - 1 week

## Resources
- **Team:** 1-2 developers with AWS CDK and Python experience
- **Tools:** AWS CLI, CDK CLI, Python 3.12, Git, VS Code, Docker
- **Infrastructure:** AWS Account with appropriate permissions, CDK bootstrap stack

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks:** CDK version compatibility issues, AWS service limits, complex IAM permissions
- **Security Risks:** Misconfigured security groups, exposed sensitive data, insufficient access controls
- **Timeline Risks:** AWS service availability, CDK learning curve, infrastructure complexity

## Success Metrics
- **Performance:** Infrastructure deployment time < 10 minutes, CDK synthesis time < 2 minutes
- **Security:** All resources properly secured, no public access to sensitive data, encryption enabled
- **User Experience:** Clean, maintainable CDK code structure, comprehensive documentation
- **Code Quality:** 90% test coverage, linting compliance, proper error handling
