## Technical Design

### Architecture
**Microservices Architecture with Event-Driven Design:**
- **Frontend:** React-based SPA with Progressive Web App capabilities
- **API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway with authentication and rate limiting
- **Data Ingestion Service:** Serverless functions for air quality data collection
- **User Service:** User profile and authentication management
- **Guidance Service:** LLM-powered recommendation engine using AWS Bedrock AgentCore
- **Notification Service:** Multi-channel notification delivery
- **Data Storage:** Dynamodb for user data, S3 for logs
- **Message Queue:** AWS SQS for asynchronous processing

### Data Model
**Core Entities:**
- **Users:** Profile, preferences, health data, location settings
- **AirQualityData:** Timestamp, location, pollutant levels, AQI calculations
- **UserAlerts:** Alert history, notification preferences, delivery status
- **GuidanceRecommendations:** Personalized advice, risk assessments, action items
- **SystemMetrics:** Performance, usage, error tracking

**Data Relationships:**
- Users have many AirQualityData readings (location-based)
- Users have many UserAlerts (notification history)
- AirQualityData generates GuidanceRecommendations
- All entities link to SystemMetrics for monitoring

### API Design
**RESTful API with GraphQL for complex queries:**
- `GET /api/air-quality/current` - Current air quality for location
- `GET /api/air-quality/history` - Historical air quality data
- `POST /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/guidance/recommendations` - Personalized guidance
- `POST /api/notifications/subscribe` - Notification preferences
- `GET /api/health/status` - System health check

**GraphQL Endpoints:**
- Complex data queries with field selection
- Real-time subscriptions for air quality updates
